	<p style="font-family:'Arial'">
    <p>Before bringing your bike in, please contact me first by email or phone.
Not all repairs can be done on-site, and I’ll need to confirm if I can help with your specific issue.

✅ This helps avoid wasted trips and ensures I have the right tools or parts ready.

Thanks for understanding!.</p>

<h2>💬 Need something else?</h2>
<p>If the service you need isn’t listed here, just call or email me to check if I can do it.<p>
<h2>📦 Parts Policy</h2>

<p>It’s better if you bring your own parts – this usually means you’ll get your bike back faster.
When a service says “parts extra,” that does not apply if you bring your own parts.

I can still provide parts if needed, but availability may affect turnaround time.<p>
<h2>💸 Why Pay More? Choose Hugo Velo Instead.</h2>
<p>Big bike shops often charge premium prices for even the most basic repairs —<p>
<p>sometimes upwards of $120+ for a tune-up or $30 just to fix a flat tire.<p>
<p>On top of that, you’re often left waiting days or even weeks to get your bike back.<p>
<p>If what I did was a really quick repair I will probably make you pay less.<p>

<p>At Hugo Velo, you get:<p>

<p>✅ Honest, upfront pricing

<p>✅ Fast turnaround (especially if you bring your own parts)<p>

<p>✅ Friendly, personal service — no big-shop attitude<p>

<p>✅ Work done with care, right from my home-based shop<p>

<p>I keep things simple, fair, and affordable — because bike repair shouldn’t break the bank.<p>
