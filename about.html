    <h2>My Bio</h2>
    
    <!-- Fixed all unclosed paragraph tags -->
    <p>Hello, my name is Hugo.</p>
    <p>I live on Terry Lou Ave and I am a great bike fanatic.</p>
    <p>Since I have been a kid I loved bikes.</p>
    <p>My love for bikes grew in Canada where I found my freedom in the nearest parking lot to our house.</p>
    <p>After Canada, me and my family moved to Miami.</p>
    <p>As some of you may know Miami and Bikes don't go very well together.</p>
    <p>In 2023, 969 total bicycle crashes have been recorded solely in Miami-Dade County.</p>
    <p>Miami in fact, has one of the highest rates of bicycle-related injuries and fatalities in the United States.</p>
    <p>That's crazy to think about. So of course, I as a 10 year old could not resort to bikes for freedom.</p>
    <p>The more I grew the more I grew impatient to hop on a bicycle.</p>
    <p>As soon as my parents told me we were moving to Mass, my heart leaped out of my chest.</p>
    <p>To conclude, ever since I have been here I have done a lot of bike riding and repairing.</p>
    <p>I recently joined a group called the Falmouth Bike Lab.</p>
    <p>I volunteer there every Thursday to help with repairs and giveaways, so if you want to swing by, you can.</p>
    <p>Every now and then you will see me riding a different bike every time on Terry Lou Ave.</p>
    <p>Whether it's a huge Mountain Bike (MTB) or a small pink little girl's bike.</p>
    <p>Looking forward to seeing you at:</p>
